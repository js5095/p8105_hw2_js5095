## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read the precipitation data of 2017 and 2018

``` r
precip_2017 =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2018 =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Combine annual precipitation

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df =
  bind_rows(precip_2017,precip_2018)

precip_df =
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month") %>%
  relocate(month_name, .after = "year")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

### 2.1 Read the NYC Transit dataset

``` r
NYCTransit_df = 
  read_csv(
    "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The NYC Transit dataset now contains the following variables: line,
station\_name, station\_latitude, station\_longitude, route1, route2,
route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, entry, vending, entrance\_type, ada.  
The data cleaning steps includes extraction of 19 columns out of the
original dataset with names modified to lowercase and space replaced
with "\_“, as well as the conversion of”entry" variables from character
to logical.  
Now the resulting dataframe has the dimension of 1868, 19, containing
1868 rows and 19 columns.

### 2.2 Question 1: How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
distinct_station = (
  NYCTransit_df %>%
    distinct(station_name, line) %>% 
    nrow()
)
```

There are 465 distinct stations.

### 2.3 Question 2: How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
ADA_station = (
  NYCTransit_df %>%
    filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
    distinct(station_name, line) %>%
    nrow()
)
```

There are 84 ADA compliant stations.

### 2.4 Question 3: What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

``` r
entry_no_vending_entrance = (
  NYCTransit_df %>%
    filter(entry == TRUE & vending == "NO") %>%
    nrow()
)

no_vending_entrance = (
  NYCTransit_df %>%
    filter(vending == "NO") %>%
    nrow()
)

prop = entry_no_vending_entrance/no_vending_entrance
```

The proportion is 0.3770492.

### 2.5 Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train?

``` r
distinct_station_A =
  NYCTransit_df %>% 
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11) %>%
  filter(route_name == 'A') %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line) %>% 
  nrow()
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train.

### 2.6 Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

``` r
ADA_compliant_A =
  NYCTransit_df %>% 
  gather(key = route_number, value = route_name, route1:route11) %>%
  filter(route_name == 'A', ada == TRUE) %>% 
  distinct(station_name, line) %>% 
  nrow()
```

Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 of them are ADA compliant.
